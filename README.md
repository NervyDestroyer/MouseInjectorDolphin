# Mouse Injector for Dolphin 5.0 (11990)

Get the latest release from [here](https://github.com/NervyDestroyer/MouseInjectorDolphin/releases).

A external app that injects cursor input into game memory, bundled with Dolphin emulator. 

## Is this Actively Maintained?
No. I just added support for the Europe version of TimeSplitters: Future Perfect. The original author no longer supports this and I have no immediately plans to either.

# How to Use
Download the zip archive of the standalone from [releases](https://github.com/NervyDestroyer/MouseInjectorDolphin/releases) (not the source code) and unzip it anywhere you'd like. This standalone is packaged with Dolphin 5.0 (11990).

After unzipping run the included Dolphin.exe and open a ROM of any supported title. Then start MouseInjectorDolphin.exe and follow the on-screen instructions. You can then press 4 to start injecting (and there will be various other options you tweak).

There is a readme included with the standalone that may provide more details.

If this doesn't work, feel free to DM or create an issue. If it's a simple fix, I'll look at it. If it looks complicated, please see my note about this not being actively maintained.
